# Pes
Managing expenses and acounting is a difficult task .As i live on rent with two more partners accounting for daily expenditure was a hard task for me expecially if it's on pen and paper that is why i created Pes (Public Expenditure System) to Bring our accounting system online.

This application uses a postgresql database.
the login credintials of postgres is in index.js and not in .env as i will use it on my local server but if you are going to use it on public server or you want to be safe please make a .env file and put your login credintials in there.

for now want to enter muliple file doesn't works but i will update it soon!
